# Infinitarium
Experimental project mainly to learn the Metal API and possibly produce something useful as a side effect. Current goal is something along the lines of a modernized and more desktop/end user oriented version of 'Partiview' (a large data-set viewer from University of Illinois).

# Supported Platforms
Only OSX Mojave with XCode 10 has been tested and is currently supported. Future plans include Windows and Linux support with a Vulkan graphics backend.
