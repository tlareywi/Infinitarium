The python import files require Python3 and the Astropy package. They
also require the Infinitarium Engine library to be built and installed. The
output is an ieb (Infinitarium Engine Binary) file which can be loaded by the
viewer application.

Raw source data is not included as it's too big to maintain in a private code
repository, but it can be obtained from CDS VizieR among other sources.
Additional info can be found in the import py files.
